Renders in double resolution (e.g 1920x810 to 3840x1620), as well as converts to 60fps for best YouTube compression.

The options consist of NVENC, XVID, and PRORES. Type which option you want in order for the render to begin.

NVENC option retains colorspace, as vdubbing washes out red values after any kind of compression.

If you plan on editing compression settings, I do not recommend setting the NVENC -qp value lower than 11 as it will begin to create artifacts.
